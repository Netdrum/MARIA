Maritime Automated Response and Intelligent Assistant Project 
The design and development of a Maritime Automated Response & Intelligent Assistant
(M.A.R.I.A.) for Coast Guard Operations.
Rescue Coordianion Staff maintain a listening watch on up to ten radio maritime
channels simultaneously. A typed log for every communication received or transmitted is
required for incident reviews and investigations. During times of high volumes of radio traffic,
it is difficult to keep the radio log updated and accurate. Maintaining the radio log can add
additional stress to staff when dealing with emergencies at sea.
This research project proposes a concept to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assit with RCC operations.
The Maritime Automated Response & Intelligent Assistant (M.A.R.I.A.) for Coast Guard Operations will monitor the radio
channels and complete the radio log for the RCC watch Officers. M.A.R.I.A will detect key words such as
MAYDAY and alert the staff of a potential distress situations, it will recognise the construct of
a marine radio calls and extract information such as vessel identification and position.
The development and design of M.A.R.I.A will harness deep learning systems which are a
combination of Generative AI, Large Language Models and Automatic Speech Recognition
systems. These models are commercially available but will require prompt tuning to enable the
AI to understand speech from marine radio.
This concept is being developed as part of a reach study for a Professional Doctorate in Engineering. 
The concepts, ideas and code provided on this GitHub page are purely for research porposes 
and should not be considered as solution to adapted in any real life siuation or work place. 

Code update November 2024

Early concepts research and development 
Objectives to create a dataset using audio files transcribed by the OpenAI whisper small model
Create a dataset from the corrected transcribed audio files and publish the dataset to Hugging Face (HF)
The published dataset will have a train test split 
Fine tune the whisper small model and evulate the results
